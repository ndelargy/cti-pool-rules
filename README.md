# CTI Pool Rules

## The break
Break in the first frame may be decided on the flip of a coin if both players agree, or by "closest to the cushion".
For games with more than one frame, the break alternates between the players.

### Closest to the cushion

Each player plays the cue ball from baulk, rebounding off the bottom cushion. The player who gets closest to the baulk cushion may choose who breaks.

If the white is potted off the break, then play switches to the other player but he/she only has one shot.
If the white leaves the table completely, two shots are awarded to the other player.
If less than four balls hit a cushion and no balls are potted, two shots are awarded to the other player.

If the player pots the black, the frame is reracked.

If the player pots one or more normal balls, he/she must choose spots or stripes.

## Legal shot
A legal shot is one where
 - The cue ball hits an object ball 
 - And then either the cue ball or the object ball hits a cushion or the object ball is potted

If the player cannot see both sides of any of his object balls, then he/she is snookered and the fair shot requirement is not enforced.

## Fouls
 - Hitting the opponents ball
 - Missing all the balls
 - Hitting the black before clearing the other balls
 - Potting the cue ball
 - Failing to make a legal shot
 - Touching the table holding any food or drink
 - Not playing the cue ball forward after placing the cue ball in baulk

After commiting a foul, the other player has two visits.  Unless he/she is on the black
If the white is potted or the player is snookered he may opt to place the cue ball anywhere in baulk.
If the player places the ball in baulk, he/she must play the ball forward.

A player may deliberately foul, the normal penalty will apply.

Except for where the rules above disagree, all other rules from the World Eight Ball Pool Federation Rules Unabridged Version Issued January 2009 apply. http://www.epa.org.uk/wrules.php
