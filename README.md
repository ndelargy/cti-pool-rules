# CTI Pool Rules

## The break
Break in the first frame may be decided on the flip of a coin if both players agree, or by "closest to the cushion".
For games with more than one frame, the break alternates between the players.

#### Closest to the cushion

Each player plays the cue ball from baulk, rebounding off the bottom cushion. The player who gets closest to the baulk cushion may choose who breaks.

### Foul break

If the white is potted off the break, then play switches to the other player but he/she only has one shot.

If the white leaves the table completely, two shots are awarded to the other player.

If less than four balls hit a cushion and no balls are potted, two shots are awarded to the other player.

If the player pots the black, the frame is reracked and the same player breaks again.

If the player pots one or more normal balls off the break, he/she must choose spots or stripes.

### Open table

The table is open until one player legally pots a ball.  At this point the player has elected to play that set of balls. i.e. if the player pots a stripe, then that player is on stripes, the opponent is on spots.

Potting a spot and a stripe other than off the break is a foul shot.

## Legal shot
A legal shot is one where
 - The cue ball hits an object ball 
 - And then either the cue ball or the object ball hits a cushion or the object ball is potted

## Snookers
A player is snookered if he/she cannot hit any of their own balls without using a cushion.

The fair shot requirement is not enforced.

## Fouls
 - Hitting the opponents ball
 - Missing all the balls
 - Any ball leaves the table
 - Hitting the black before clearing the other balls
 - Potting the cue ball
 - Failing to make a legal shot
 - Not playing the cue ball forward after placing the cue ball in baulk
 - Potting a spot and a stripe in one shot, (other than off the break)
  
*These fouls are less well known, but are intended to prevent damage to the table or to the venue*
 - Deliberate jump shots are illegal
 - Touching the table holding any food or drink
 - Placing food or drink on any part of the table

After commiting a foul, the other player has two visits.  Unless he/she is on the black.

Two shots do not carry, so if the player pots on his/her first shot play will switch to the opponent as usual.

If the white is potted place the cue ball anywhere in baulk.

If the player is snookered he/she may opt to...
 - place the white in baulk
 - use the first shot to play in to space
 - Play an opponents ball or play the black ball

Players may not pot an opponents ball or the black on the first of two shots.

Players may not play an opponents ball or the black unless snookered.

If the player places the ball in baulk, he/she must play the ball forward.


## Deliberate foul
A player may deliberately foul, the normal penalty will apply.

## Replacing balls

Any balls leaving the table which has not been potted will be re spotted as near as possible to the black spot in a direct line between the spot and the centre point of the cushion that lies the greatest distance from the Baulk Line.

## Balls falling without being hit

Any ball that falls into a pocket at any time, without being struck, shall be replaced by the Referee to its original position, no penalty. 

## Rules not listed above

Most of these rules summarised are the same as the 2009 world rules, the exceptions are playing the cue ball forward from baulk, and single shot on the black.

Except for where the rules above disagree, all other rules from the World Eight Ball Pool Federation Rules Unabridged Version Issued January 2009 apply. http://www.epa.org.uk/wrules.php
